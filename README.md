# Apple webpage Clone

This is a clone application of Apple WebPage
<br>

In this project, our aim here wasn’t to produce an replica of the Apple webpage, but rather to focus on how to use positioning declarations in CSS. That means two things – laying out the basic structure of the page using semantic HTML elements and ensuring that the elements are appropriately sized and positioned.


## Built with
  * HTML 
  * CSS (Box Model, Float, Grid, Flex and Positioning)
  * Lint (Stickler)
  * W3C Validator

## Live demo


## Getting started
**For this project, we tried our best to recreate the Apple home page. The main aim is to ensure the elements get placed and styled roughly the same way as the page, so functionality is not a priority.**

We used the browser’s developer tools to inspect the real page to understand how elements are placed and styled.
We built our own page in a .html text file and opened it in our browser to check it out.
